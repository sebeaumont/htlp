# Type level hackery in Haskell

This is my exploration of learning how to hack at type level in God's own
language.

Time to raise my game and promote my values to types. Well ghc has an
extension for that (of course)...

My intension is to turn all this into a tutorial style blog post once
I've grasped the basics and done something practical other than follow
along the ```singletons``` papers. In the hope that it might help
others get down the road.

But now I have a copy of Sandy McGuire's "Thinking with Types" - Type
Level Programming in Haskell I'll do all my exercises here for that.
Which surely will be a better introduction.
